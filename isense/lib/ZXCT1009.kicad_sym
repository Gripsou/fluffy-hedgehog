		(property "Description" "The ZXCT1009 is a high side current sense monitor. Using this device eliminates the need to disrupt the ground plane when sensing a load current. It takes a high side voltage developed across a current shunt resistor and translates it into a proportional output current. A user defined output resistor scales the output current into a ground-referenced voltage. The wide input voltage range of 20V down to as low as 2.5V make it suitable for a range of applications. A minimum operating current of just 4Î¼A, combined with its SOT23 package make it a unique solution for portable battery equipment"
